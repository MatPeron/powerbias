System_parameters:
    # Number of processors to be used in parallel computation (-1 for all processors available)

Pk_parameters:
    # Path of the simulation file containing the catalog
    simfile: /mnt/mergerSIM/GalaxyProp/CompleteSample_HostProperties_mobse_vcm_2021_GW_BBHs_merge28.h5
    # Side length of the simulation box in [h^-1 Mpc]
    L: 67.77
    # Number of grid points per side
    Ng: 256
    # File that is used to read the simulation file and output an array of shape (N,3) of particle positions (N is the number of particles)
    # Rules:
    #   - "file_path" requires the absolute path of the file
    #   - file must be a python script containing a function named "readSim"
    #   - readSim must accept the file name of the simulation file to be read as first positional argument
    #   - readSim can accept any other argument beside the file name, such arguments must be specified in a dictionary using "args"
    #   - readSim must return a (N,3) numpy array of particle positions
    #
    # NOTE: Mass binning (for halo power spectra for example), or any other binning based on source properties should be done within readSim
