System_parameters:
    # Number of processors to be used in parallel computation (-1 for all processors available)
    nproc: -1

Pk_parameters:
    # OPTIONAL: write any string that describes the source the power spectrum refers to
    source_type: brief description of the source type
    # Side length of the simulation box in [h^-1 Mpc]
    L: 67.77
    # Number of grid points per side
    Ng: 256
    # File that is used to read the simulation file and output an array of shape (N,3) of particle positions (N is the number of particles)
    # Rules:
    #   - "file_path" requires the absolute path of the file
    #   - file must be a python script containing a function named "readSim"
    #   - readSim must accept the file name of the simulation file to be read as first positional argument
    #   - readSim can accept any other argument beside the file name, such arguments must be specified in a dictionary using "args"
    #   - readSim must return a (N,3) numpy array of particle positions
    #
    # NOTE: Mass binning (for halo power spectra for example), or any other binning based on source properties should be done within readSim
    read_sim_func:
        file_path: /home/ubuntu/Pk_clustercompute/compute_PS/example/read_sim.py
        args: {}

MCMC_parameters:
    # Random number generator seed for MCMC sampler
    seed: 123456789
    # WRITE HERE ALL THE VARIABLES FOR MCMC SAMPLER
